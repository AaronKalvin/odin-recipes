    <h2 class="sub-head">Ingredients</h2>

            <li>3/4 cup water</li>
            <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 (3 inch) cinnamon stick</li>

    <h2 class="sub-head">Steps</h2>

        <ol class="sub-body">
            <li>Gather all Ingredients</li>
            <li>Combine water, sugar, and cinnamon stick in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low.</li>
            <li>Cut one orange in half; squeeze orange halves over the sugar mixture to relase their juice. Push 5 cloves
                 into the outside of each orange pee; place peels into the simmering mixture. Continue to simmer over the lowest
                  heat until thick and syrupy, 20 to 30 minuts.</li>
            <li>While the mixture is simmering, slice remaining orange and set aside for serving.</li>
            <li>When the mixture is finished simmering, stir in wine and heat until steaming but not simmering, 3 to 5 
                minutes. Discard orange peels and cinnamon stick.</li>
            <li>Ladle into mugs and garnish with orange slices. Prost!</li>
