# odin-recipes
My first odin project!

This is my first actual self taught project in 'The Odin Project' curriculum. Contained within will be a recipe. If you're reading this, I likely already figured out which recipe it will be... or perhaps I didn't. Maybe brownies?... I love them. But at the same time, a nice stir fry or mexican meal sounds good. I guess I'm a little hungry. Its only 8am though... oh well. Thanks for stopping by!
